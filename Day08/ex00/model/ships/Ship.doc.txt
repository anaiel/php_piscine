public  void    move ( array $coords );

current position of the ship).

public  void    changePhase ( string $newPhase );

~~~~~~~~ DEV LOG
At the start they are placed as way from the opposite corners (top-left and
bottom-right) as necessary to allow the ships to rotate (since they rotate
around the middle of the ship)
For now ships are all equiped with one single FlankLasers weapon.
