<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles 3D vectors.

An Vector is constructed from two instances of the Vertex class, corresponding
to the destination ('dest') and the origin ('orig') of the vector. The origin is
optional, and defaults to a Vertex with coordinates (0, 0, 0) and a w of 1.
new Vector ( array (
        'dest' = new Vertex ( array( 'x' => 5, 'y' => 8, 'z' => 6, 'w' => 2 ) )
    )
);

The class provides the following methods:

float   magnitude();
Returns the length of the vector.

Vector normalize();
Returns a new vector corresponding to the normalization of the current Vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs );
Returns the sum of the current Vector and the parameter.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the difference between the current Vector and the parameter;

Vector opposite ();
Returns a new Vector which is the opposite of the current Vector;

Vector scalarProduct( $k );
Returns a new Vector which is the product of the current Vector with the
scalar parameter.

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the dot product of the current Vector and the parameter.

float cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cosinus of the angle between the current Vector and the parameter.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns a new Vector which is the vector product of the current Vector and the
parameter.
