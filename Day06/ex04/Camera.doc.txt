<- Camera ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Camera class simulates an observer to allow for 2D projection.

A Camera instance is constructed from the following parameters:
Vertex origin : position of the camera in the 3D world
Matrix orientation : rotation matrix for the orientation of the camera
float ratio : ratio of the 2D projection image. Is also accepted as a
    combination of:
    float width
    float height
float fov : field of vision of the projected image
float near : near clipping
float far : far clipping

The Camera instance provides the following method:

Vertex watchVertex ( Vertex $worldVertex );
Projects the vertex from the 3D world to a 2D image from the viewpoint of the
current Camera instance.
