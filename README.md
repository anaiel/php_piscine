# Piscine PHP

The Piscine PHP is a 2 weeks intensive program to learn the basics of PHP at the 42 computer science school. Exercices are grouped into "days", and each day has to be turned in within a specific timeframe; and during the two weekends, a bigger group projects, called a "rush", has to be completed.

I participated in the piscine between 19-05-20 and 19-06-02.
